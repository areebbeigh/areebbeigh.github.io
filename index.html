    <h2>The story</h2>
    <p>
      My first laptop was my dad's office laptop in 2013. The only
      computer experience I had before this was in school, where the first
      thing we would do on booting up a system was changing the
      screensaver and the second being 2 player pinball. <br /><br />

      I pretty much instantly got into gaming (at least into games the laptop
      could handle). I didn't take an interest in coding until late 2015 -
      still was struggling to figure out how to get my mom's power point presentations
      to look the right way. During 2014-15, I'd gotten into multiplayer games
      and was an active member of some IRC networks - met some awesome
      people around these places (game scripters, network admins, and
      some computer geeks in general). I guess some of it rubbed off on me.

      <br /><br />
      It was during this time I'd tried a couple of things:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tried
          running my own
          <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160129020755/http://irchound.tk/about.html"
            target="_blank"
            >IRC network</a
          >
          after borrowing some friends' servers - it stayed up for the better
          part of a year but then I got busy with school. Probably my first
          experience with servers (and failing to start something on the internet).
        </li>
        <li>
          Played around with
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC_scripting_language"
            target="_blank"
            >mIRC scripting</a
          >
          and created an IRC administration bot. Wish I still had the code
          around. It's somewhere out there on pastebin though. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      Enter late 2015, someone pushed me to learn to program and suggested Python 2. I picked up
      Zed A. Shaw's
      <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/" target="_blank"
        >Learn Python 2 The Hard Way</a
      >
      and that was it. Never stopped since. A second IRC bot came out of
      all this for which, fortunately, I still have the
      <a href="https://github.com/areebbeigh/rss2irc" target="_blank"
        >code.</a
      >
